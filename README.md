  The Fiber Optics Research Paper was done in grade 12 physics, as a way to develop my skills in scientific writing. I was tasked with writing a paper explaining the physics behind fiber optics, and their history. This paper got a perfect grade by my teacher. It is relevant in today's world due to the changing nature of data transmission. One area for improvement in this paper would be to compare fiber optics to traditional copper wiring, which would demonstrate why organizations are switching from copper to fiber optics.
